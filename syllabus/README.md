# Data Mining: CSCI 347, Spring 2021

## Course Description

The efficient analysis of large, complex, and rapidly changing data sets is fast
becoming a necessity in nearly every large industry in today's era of big data.
We are in need of new algorithms that can provide sensible solutions to problems
involving large, messy, incomplete, and often rapidly changing data sets. This
need for computationally efficient algorithms that help us understand modern
data has sparked developments in the relatively new fields of data science, data
mining, and machine learning, which combine ideas from computer science,
statistics, linear algebra, and related fields. This course is a first
introduction to popular techniques, algorithms, and tools available for the
analysis of real-world data sets. Building on mathematical and computational
foundations from statistics, linear algebra, and computer science, students will
learn common approaches to knowledge extraction from data. Some techniques will
be covered in detail, but the goal of the course is to provide students an
overview of a broad range of tools and techniques available for data analysis.
Students will be given plenty of opportunities to practice applying data science
concepts to varied examples of real-world data, as well as practice interpreting
and presenting the results of their analyses. An introduction to advanced topics
in data mining will allow interested students to choose from a wide range of
data science sub-fields for further study, according to personal preferences and
goals.

## Pre-Requisites

Students are expected to have taken a statistics/probability course, and have
some experience programming. Namely, STAT 216Q or STAT 332, as well as CSCI 232,
are required. Familiarity with the Python programming language is preferred. An
introductory linear algebra course and a basic discrete structures course are
also strongly recommended. A thorough understanding of these topics will greatly
enhance students' understanding of the fundamental methods and algorithms
underlying data mining techniques, tools, and packages. Students are strongly
encouraged to take M 221 and CSCI 246 prior to enrolling in this course.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Identify common data types used in data mining
* Describe popular techniques for data pre-processing
* Apply appropriate algorithms for data mining and knowledge discovery to a
  real-world data set using the Python programming language
* Construct a computational pipeline from existing tools to solve a data mining
  problem
* Identify common issues and challenges in working with large data sets

## Expectations

**Meeting Time:** Tue, Thurs 15:05-16:20, 008 Romney Hall

**Quizzes:** We will have weekly quizzes.  That is, there will be a quiz posted
on or before Tue. Students are encouraged to complete the quiz after lecture on
Thurs (but the quiz will be due before class on Tue)

**Homework:** All homework is to be completed individually, although online
collaboration and cooperation with classmates is encouraged. Students are
encouraged to use the course Discord to ask homework-related questions. Homework
should be turned in on Gradescope and Brightspace.

**Exam:** There will be one in class exam on **TODO**.

**Projects:**  A total of three projects will constitute the project grade.
Projects can be completed either individually or with a partner.

**Final Project:** The final project can be completed either individually or
with a partner.

## Grading

All homework assignments and projects will be turned in on Brightspace and
Gradescope. Quizzes will be submitted on Brightspace. All course resources
(code, notes, project instructions, etc.), will be available on Github.

* 30% Homework (approx 8 - about every other week)
* 10% Quizzes (approx 14 - about one per week)
* 30% Projects (three)
* 15% Exam (one)
* 15% Final Project

Note that the tool that I use for grading documents only works with a text
editor/jupyter or PDFs. So any file format other than code (e.g. `.py` or
`.ipynb`) or PDF (e.g. `.docx`, `.rtf`, etc)  will receive a **ZERO**. Homework
is due at 23:59 Mountain time on the due date. Late homework will not be
accepted.

I encourage collaboration, see collaboration section for details.

## Policies

### Attendance

Attendance in class with not be taken but students are responsible for all
material covered in class. Attendance is strongly recommended.

### Discussion

Group discussions, questions, and announcements will take place on **TBA**. It
is okay to send me a direct message or email if you have a question that you
feel is not appropriate to share with the class.  If, however, you send me an
message with a question for which the response would be useful to the rest of
the class, I will likely ask you to post publicly.

### Collaboration

Collaboration IS encouraged, however, all submitted individual work must be your
own and you must acknowledge your collaborators at the beginning of the
submission.

On any group project, every team member is expected to make a substantial
contribution. The distribution of the work, however, is up to the team.

A few specifics for the assignments.  You may:

* Work with anyone in the course.
* Share ideas with others in the course
* Help other teams debug their code or proofs.

You may NOT:

* Submit a proof or code that you did not write.
* Modify another's proof or code and claim it as your own.

Using resources in addition to the course materials is encouraged. But, be sure
to properly cite additional resources. Remember, it is NEVER acceptable to pass
others work off as your own.

Paraphrasing or quoting another's work without citing the source is a form of
academic misconduct. Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation
of another's work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not
acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you have any questions about using
and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification. My rule of thumb
is if I am in doubt, I cite.

By participating in this class, you agree to abide by the [student code of
conduct](http://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/).  Please review the
policy.

### Classroom Etiquette

Except for note taking and coding, please keep electronic devices off during
class, they can be distractions to other students. Disruptions to the class will
result in you being asked to leave the lecture and will negatively impact your
grade.

### Special needs information

If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation(s), you are encouraged to contact me and Disabled Student Services
as soon as possible.

If you are a student with a disability and wish to use your approved
accommodations for this course, please contact me during my office hours to
discuss. Please have your Accommodation Notification or Blue Card available for
verification of accommodations.  Accommodations are approved through the Office
of Disability Services located in SUB 174. Please see [Disability Services for
more information](http://www.montana.edu/disabilityservices).

### COVID Stuff

See [COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus/faq.html)
for the most up to date info.

Some important stuff as of on January 19, 2022:

Given the elevated rate of transmission of COVID-19 and its variants in our
community, including the omicron variant, face masks or coverings are required
in all indoor spaces on the Bozeman campus, with the exception of the fitness
center, where strenuous physical activity makes optional masks a better practice

From Provost Mokwa's communication on 8/13/2021

Montana State University encourages students, faculty and staff to take
advantage of convenient, on-campus clinics for the COVID-19 vaccine. Schedule
your appointment by going to
[www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus](www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus)

In the event of contagious illness, please do not come to class or to campus to
turn in work. You should email me if you will miss class due to illness as soon
as practical.
