# CSCI 347: Data Mining

## Abbreviated Course Description

The efficient analysis of large, complex, and rapidly changing data sets is fast
becoming a necessity in nearly every large industry in today's era of big data.
We are in need of new algorithms that can provide sensible solutions to problems
involving large, messy, incomplete, and often rapidly changing data sets. This
course is a first introduction to popular techniques, algorithms, and tools
available for the analysis of real-world data sets.
